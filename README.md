This is the first iteration of a personal portfolio website. The website
currently has a short bio and a resume. In the future, I would like to 
include a sampling of my coursework, and further develop usability
features of the site.

I believe that everything was implemented correclty, except for perhaps
the bold face span class. I think that some combination of the font
family and the font weight made it a slightly erratic problem. 
Ultimately I liked how it looked without the bold, and decided to leave
it be at least for this first iteration of the website. In future
development I would like to implement far more advanced design tactics.

I discussed the assignment with Billy Chupp. We talked about the project
and I helped him get more acclimated to HTML and CSS.

It took me approximately 3-4 hours to complete this assignment.
