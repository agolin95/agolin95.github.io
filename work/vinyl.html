<p class="section-head">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p class="section">Purpose</p>
<p>The purpose of this paper is to provide the reader with an evaluation of the current popularity of vinyl records and
    the reasons people have returned to collecting physical versions of albums instead of buying music digitally. After
    reading this paper,
    the reader will understand how vinyl compares to other formats in the modern music industry, and will be informed
    enough to decide whether he would like to start a vinyl collection of his own.</p>
<p class="section">Scope</p>
<p>I begin the paper with a brief introduction to vinyl records and how they work. In the second section of this paper,
    I discuss the invention and history of vinyl records through the 20th Century. I highlight the dominance of vinyl
    until its rapid decline
    due to the invention the CD. I then discuss the rapid rise in vinyl sales that began in 2008. In the third section,
    I explore the myriad reasons that people are once more flocking to record stores, including industry gimmicks,
    increased social interaction
    while perusing and purchasing music, a psychological fascination with collecting physical items, and an alleged
    improvement in sound quality. In the fourth section, I note the obstacles facing vinyl sales and the ways vinyl
    pressers (the individuals
    responsible for fabricating the records) hope to deal with these obstacles. I conclude the paper with a broader look
    at the modern music industry and an evaluation of how vinyl may continue to play an important role as a competing
    format depending
    on how the general public, including the readers of this paper, decide to listen to their music.</p>
<p class="section">Introduction to Vinyl</p>
<p>Vinyl records are composed of polyvinyl chloride, a chemical compound that is a versatile and durable plastic, which
    is shaped into discs and imprinted with grooves. The grooves of vinyl records are formed through the translation of
    electrical impulses
    to an etching device, and these grooves are reverse translated by the needles of record players. Vinyl records are
    played on turntables, which are modern-day adaptations of the original gramophones (rudimentary, mechanical versions
    of modern turntables)
    present before the turn of the 19th Century. Modern turntables come in many designs and degrees of technological
    power. Some turntables can be purchased as stand-alone audio centers, which can read the grooves of the record,
    process the sounds, and
    also emit the sounds through speakers. Some minimalistic turntables, on the other hand, merely read the grooves of a
    record and require an external apparatus to emit sound.</p>
<p class="section-head">THE RISE, FALL, AND REVIVAL OF VINYL</p>
<p class="section">The Rise</p>
<p>In the late 1800s, Emile Berliner created the direct precursor to modern turntables and vinyl records: the
    gramophone. Berliner’s gramophone played etched disks and ultimately became the foundation for modern-day vinyl
    records, though he used less technically
    advanced materials for his disks and players than we use today. The dominant method of listening to music closely
    followed Berliner’s gramophone model through most of the 20th Century. A grooved disk would be placed on a rotating
    table and a needle
    would read the grooves and translate them into amplified vibrations. As technology improved, the amplified
    vibrations were replaced with electrical impulses and the materials used for the disks and needles became more
    advanced. Despite the constant
    technological updates that vinyl records and turntables underwent throughout the 20th Century, they could not
    compete with digital media in the form of CDs. (Osborne 2014)</p>
<p class="section">The Fall</p>
<p>In the late 1980s, the music industry experienced a dramatic decline in vinyl record sales that coincided with the
    invention and popularization of CDs (Figure 1). Vinyl records were still being pressed, but CDs dominated the
    market. The public viewed
    CDs as an infallible format, and it was difficult for vinyl to compete. CDs were marketed as perfect, permanent, and
    compact, all of which vinyl records were not. Vinyl could be worn down through use, and it took up a large amount of
    space compared
    to CDs. Most of all, vinyl was imperfect and had static, dust, and scratches. CD sales were remarkably high in the
    1990s and still make up a sizeable percentage of all music sales today. (Hogan 2014)</p>

<p class="section">The Revival</p>
<p>When digital downloads, digital streaming, and pirating became popular, the death of the CD seemed to be rapidly
    approaching, so the fact that vinyl records experienced drastically increased sales starting in 2008 came as a
    shock. Vinyl sales in 2008
    almost doubled from the previous year, and since then, sales have continued to climb at impressive rates. In 2013,
    6.1 million vinyl albums were sold, which marked a six-fold increase from the 1 million vinyl albums sold in 2007
    (Oliphint 2014). These
    numbers are impressive, but in actuality, vinyl sales still only constitute about two percent of the total industry
    sales (Figures 2 and 3). Even if the percentage of sales is small, the music industry cannot disregard the
    statistically significant
    increases in sales, and therefore we must examine why people are once more purchasing vinyl (Shah 2014).</p>

<p class="section-head">WHY ARE PEOPLE BUYING VINYL?</p>
<p class="section">The Individualism of Gimmicks and Special Offers</p>
<p>Vinyl pressers are churning out an unprecedented variety and quantity of specialized records, unlike the industry has
    ever experienced. The presentation and packaging of records has dramatically changed since the heyday of vinyl.
    Vinyl pressers used to
    be able to churn out hundreds of standard, black, polyvinyl chloride records, one after the next, and quickly slide
    them into their uniform sleeves. Of course, there were always some promotional or artistic gimmicks for some of the
    most prominent
    bands and albums. The difference in the modern vinyl industry is that every band, regardless of their popularity,
    seems to want to print their album in wide arrays of colors, and demands that eye-catching inserts like stickers and
    download cards be
    placed in every record sleeve (Khanna 2014). Some artists are even asking for records that include glitter, coffee
    grounds, ashes of a bible, and even their own blood, but vinyl pressers generally refuse the requests for blood
    (Oliphint 2014).</p>
<p>The increase in promotional gimmicks is changing the landscape of vinyl retail, and the success of such gimmicks
    suggests something very important about public consumerism - the modern vinyl consumer is looking for more than just
    a way to listen to music.
    A vinyl consumer in the modern age is looking for an aesthetic, physical testament to his or her unique brand of
    fandom, and artists are trying to capitalize on this desire by offering limited-time promotional deals and diverse
    prints of their albums
    (Khanna 2014). The success of these unique, limited- time offers may suggest that people have a psychological
    fascination with individualism. However, at the same time, people are finding a great deal of value in the sense of
    community fostered by
    record purchasing and record stores.</p>
<p class="section">Record Store Day and the Social Culture of Collecting</p>
<p>When digital downloads became the norm, the social culture of purchasing music completely changed, and people have
    made impressive efforts to reestablish the social culture of vinyl stores. People are now able to buy any song in
    the world without ever
    having to leave their home, which means that they might be missing out on meaningful conversations with fellow
    record store patrons and employees. In an attempt to reclaim the social culture of buying music, a conglomeration of
    independent storeowners
    and employees founded Record Store Day in 2007 and held the first one in April of 2008. Record Store Day is an
    international campaign that seeks to bring attention to the still flourishing culture of independent record stores
    around the world. For
    one day every year, the music industry focuses its attention on vinyl records and the stores that specialize in
    selling them. Stores hold performances and offer special deals, and artists release limited-edition records to help
    garner media and consumer
    attention. (Record Store Day 2015)</p>
<p>Record Store Day has been very successful, though the success is not due solely to the intense media coverage. In
    fact, between 2013 and 2014 there was a 50% increase in sales on Record Store Day alone (G.M. 2014). One could argue
    that the media presence
    of Record Store Day is enough to cause such heightened interest in vinyl however, René de Guzman, the curator of a
    vinyl exhibit at the Museum of California, attributes the surging interest in vinyl and the success of Record Store
    Day to something
    more: “There’s a social aspect of listening to records. You share musical interests and let others know the reasons
    why certain things are meaningful to you and others. Listening to records puts music into the foreground because its
    physical nature
    requires intention and attention” (G.M. 2014). Record Store Day has been a successful tool in</p>
<p>rekindling the social culture of buying music, but it is, after all, only one day a year. Mr. Guzman is correct in
    noting the importance of the social culture and the forced attention of listening to analog records, and in fact,
    many aficionados treat
    their records in a highly attentive, almost ritualistic way.</p>
<p class="section">The Ritual of Collecting and Putting Needle to Groove</p>
<p>Clicking around a screen can feel simplistic and unfulfilling compared to the robust and personal experience of
    playing a record. As noted by Mr. Guzman in the quotation in Section 3.2, playing a record requires a great deal of
    focus and attention, and
    is a process that can be enjoyed in and of itself. Vinyl records can be smelled, touched, and physically admired;
    they are more substantive and infinitely more tangible than the cluster of pixels on a screen displaying album art
    that is too small
    to appreciate.</p>
<p>The popularity of digital media has meant that people have no longer been forming a music collection that feels as
    definitive and personal as an analog collection. Despite the fact that iTunes allows people to amass a collection of
    files, and Spotify
    allows people to click a button and save an album to a digital library, the ease with which songs and albums can be
    added and deleted has undermined the value of the library. A vinyl record is a work of art, something that can be
    hung on your wall
    or proudly displayed on a shelf. Vinyl records provide people with a way of tangibly declaring their fandom, and
    they serve as trophies because they show that a person has made the effort to walk to the store and spend upwards of
    twenty dollars to
    purchase a product from a beloved artist. Just as collecting vinyl records and perusing a vinyl library are deeply
    swayed by ritual and familiarity, so too is the actual audio experience of listening to a vinyl record. (Oliphint
    2014)</p>
<p class="section">The Allegedly Superior Sound Quality</p>
<p>Many individuals, in addition to relishing the act of playing a vinyl record, are convinced that they sound
    significantly better than any digital format available. When mp3s first appeared, the sampling rate (the digital
    approximation of an analog sound
    wave) was low, and thus the sound quality was very poor. Sampling rates were kept low for the sake of convenience
    and saving space in computer storage, but the poor quality convinced people that all digital audio sounded cheap and
    grainy (Richardson
    2013). This belief is simply untrue. Higher sampling rate mp3s are the standard now, and beyond mp3s, lossless files
    (compressed files that can be uncompressed without any loss of data) such as FLAC and WAV files are becoming
    increasingly popular.
    Some of the lossless files are so detailed that they actually surpass the level at which humans are able to perceive
    differences in sound quality. If digital files are so advanced that their flaws are imperceptible to the human ear,
    how can one possibly
    make the claim that vinyl sounds better? In actuality, vinyl does not produce inherently higher quality audio, in
    fact, vinyl audio is generally lower quality, but can actually sound more pleasing to an individual.</p>
<p>Hearing is a highly subjective experience, and no matter how much people use science to prove that digital audio can
    be considered perfect to the human ear, some individuals still insist that they prefer listening to vinyl because it
    simply sounds better
    to them. Most people cite the familiar and comforting static associated with playing a vinyl record. This static is,
    in fact, a blatant distortion of what was originally intended for the music. Another common praise of vinyl is the
    warmth of the sound.
    <span>Warmth </span>is a commonly used, vague, and poorly understood term. The alleged warmth is actually just the
    result of vinyl records being unable to precisely process the bass tones, which results in a distortion of the
    original sound. Aspects
    of vinyl such as static
</p>
<p>and warmth make it of technically lower sound quality, but if someone likes the warmth and static, the vinyl
    recording will sound better to him or her than the digital one. (Richardson 2013)</p>
<p class="section-head">OBSTACLES FACING THE VINYL REVIVAL</p>
<p class="section">Limited Resources for Production</p>
<p>With the sudden surge in demand for vinyl records and the yearly spike in orders for Record Store Day, vinyl pressing
    plants are facing high demand that they are unprepared for, which has severely strained their operations. In fact,
    demand has become
    so high that artists are frequently left without any vinyl records to sell at their record release events. Artists
    that have always ordered vinyl are ordering more, and artists that have never expressed interest in vinyl are now
    submitting large orders
    of their own. To make matters more trying, as discussed in Section 3.1, an ever-increasing amount of specialized
    orders are adding complexity to the already hectic operations of pressing plants. (Khanna 2014)</p>
<p>Only about twenty fully functional pressing plants are still in operation in the United States. Many have gone out of
    business since the vinyl heyday, and since then, few others have opened. Most of the remaining vinyl presses have
    been bought and refurbished,
    and no one is manufacturing new presses, so some people speculate that the vinyl production industry may soon reach
    its ceiling. To add to difficulties facing pressing plants, vinyl presses are complex machines and require
    well-trained professionals
    to run them. Everyone who knows how to use a press is already operating one, and with business booming, pressers
    have no time to train new employees. Even more important is that vinyl production takes more than just a
    professional; it takes an artist.
    (Khanna 2014)</p>
<p class="section">Artistic Nature of Production</p>
<p>Part of what makes vinyl pressing so difficult is that vinyl pressing, unlike CD manufacturing, is much more of an
    art than an easily reproducible science. Every aspect of a vinyl record is vital, and every step of the process is
    prone to error. Whether
    it is the vinyl disk, the groove etchings, the paper label, or the sleeve, every aspect of the finished product
    involves a human touch. No matter how consistent machine settings might be, pressers can never be sure that the
    product will turn out the
    same each time. Even on the musician’s end of the process, vinyl requires a great deal more understanding than other
    formats. Music must be properly edited for vinyl in a way that is distinctly different than for CDs, and musicians
    must understand
    that the pressing procedure is not as fast as duplicating a CD or uploading a digital file. Creating a vinyl record
    is a lengthy and personal procedure, and vinyl production is certainly slowed by the meticulousness of the process,
    however this attention
    to detail is part of what makes vinyl so special. Vinyl records are the finished product of artists that work in
    different mediums that add to and adapt one another’s work, taking nothing and turning it into sound, and taking
    sound and turning it
    into grooves. (Oliphint 2014)</p>
<p class="section-head">CONCLUSIONS</p>
<p>With the music industry very much in the throes of the vinyl revival, everyone is eagerly waiting to see how the
    vinyl industry continues to change. Some people propose that the format will just continue regaining popularity and
    eventually the pressing
    plants will catch up with demand by increasing employment or contracting new presses. Others suggest that we may
    soon reach the ceiling on vinyl production, and the revival will ultimately stagnate, which would leave vinyl to
    occupy a meager 2% of
    industry sales. Vinyl will likely never be able to replace the convenience of streaming services such as Spotify or
    Pandora, but perhaps people will start to develop a dualistic approach to building a music library. Perhaps people
    will begin digitally
    streaming for convenience in addition to collecting some of their favorite records on vinyl. A dualistic approach to
    listening to music would allow individuals to have the expansive connectivity of streaming services at their
    fingertips while still
    feeling tangibly tied to the artists they love most.</p>
<p class="section-head">RECOMMENDATIONS</p>
<p>Whatever the future may hold for vinyl, clearly vinyl records are a remarkably tenacious music format that will
    likely never fully disappear. That said, vinyl will likely never again dominate the market as it once did. Is vinyl
    a better format than CDs,
    digital downloads, or streaming services? Ultimately, the question of which format is best is a very personal
    question that every individual must ask him or herself. After reading this paper, you should have a better idea of
    how vinyl records came
    to occupy their current position in the music industry, and you should understand why many people find value in
    starting or growing their vinyl collection. If you think you might like to start your own collection, go to a record
    store and see if they
    have a demo turntable. See how it feels to manually place the record on the turntable and place the needle in the
    groove. You might just fall in love like so many have before.</p>
