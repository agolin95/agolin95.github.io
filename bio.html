				<h2>Biography</h2>
				<p>I was born in Allentown, PA on January 5, 1995. I moved to New York City at the age of three, and began attending Hunter College Elementary School at the age of 5. I stayed at Hunter through high school until 2013 at which point I came to Tufts University in Medford, MA. I began playing music when I was too young to remember, first as a pianist. I eventually lost interested in piano and dabbled in violin for a brief period before settling firmly on guitar as my instrument of choice. I began learning classical guitar in 2007, and quickly began playing acoustic and electric guitar as well. Music is my greatest passion in life, and there's nothing I want to do more than combine my personal passion with my professional interets in the field of music technology.</p>
