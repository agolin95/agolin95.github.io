This is the first iteration of a personal portfolio website. The website
currently has a short bio and a resume. In the future, I would like to 
include a sampling of my coursework, and further develop usability
features of the site.

I believe that everything was implemented correclty. In future
development I would like to implement more advanced design tactics.

I discussed the assignment with Billy Chupp. We talked about the project
and I helped him get more acclimated to HTML and CSS.

It took me approximately 3-4 hours to complete this assignment.
