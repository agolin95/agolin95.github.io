My greatest passion in life is music, and there is nothing I love more than finding new ways to combine psyschological and social principals with cutting edge technology to create unique solutions in the field of music.</h4>

    <h4 class="somervilletext" id="somervilletoptext">&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen I got to Tufts, I initally declared my major as Mechanical Engineering, but I later realized my passion lies far more in finding the hybrid paths forged by the interactions between psychology and engineering. I redeclared as a Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science double major, taking a particular interest in user centric web design. My courseload has included classes ranging anywhere between engineering sciences, applied computer programming, theoretical computer science, psychology and psychological methods, and design. My younger brother Nicholas, my favorite person in the world, joined me at Tufts as a member of the graduating class of 2019.
