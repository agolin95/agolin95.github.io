                <p>Iâ€™m a passionate musician, an equally die-hard city-boy and woods-dweller, an avid proponent of user-centric design, and an empathetic humanist, sometimes to a fault. </p> 
                <p>Seeking to hybridize my education, I double majored in Human Factors Engineering and Computer Science at Tufts University, focusing in UX design. I spent my college years as a leader in the Radio Broadcasting and DIY Concert Booking communities, where I discovered a deep passion for organizing artistic communities. I graduated Magna Cum Laude in the Spring of 2017.</p>
                <p>After graduation, I worked as a software engineer on the data visualization team at Pegasystems in Cambridge, MA. I quickly leaned into my love for helping people and began serving as a scrum master, a post I held for several years. </p>
                <p>After nearly a decade in Boston, I followed my heart home to NYC and, just as the pandemic struck, I began serving as technical program manager for MongoDB's driver teams. I help oversee the all the goings on of the drivers department and seek any opportunity to infuse my love of design and development into my day to day management work.</p>
                <p>I'd like to one day combine my passions for music, people, and technology to promote equitable compensation for independent artists and stronger community engagement for listeners and artists alike.</p>
